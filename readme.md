# AI-Based Climate-Resilient Green Lending for MSMEs

This repository contains the methodology and analytical framework used to
evaluate climate-aware green creditworthiness of MSMEs using artificial intelligence.

The model integrates:
- Financial performance indicators
- Climate physical risk proxies
- Digital readiness and ESG-related variables
- Explainable AI (SHAP) for transparency

Note:
Due to confidentiality and regulatory constraints, the dataset used is a
synthetic proxy calibrated using established financial and climate-risk literature.
The architecture, validation logic, and explainability methods are deployable
in real-world lending systems.
